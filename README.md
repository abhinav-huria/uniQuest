# uniQuest

A platform for university students to ask and answer questions anonymously. Often it is that students aren't able to connect with their peers or seniors for asking their doubts related to their college, course, placements etc. Our platform aims to solve that problem. It can be integrated into the university ecosystem. If a user logs in from the universitry domain email id, the user will be taken to that university page.
